Reference implementation for the book, "A guide to OpenSAML"

The book is available here: https://blog.samlsecurity.com/a-guide-to-opensamlv2.html

The new edition based on OpenSAML V3 is available here: https://blog.samlsecurity.com/a-guide-to-opensamlv3.html

The sole purpose of the sample project is to illustrate the function of OpenSAML. 
Although, it can be a very good place to start when experimenting with OpenSAML, it should not be used for production purposes.

> NOTE: This repository demonstrates OpenSaml 2.6.0. <br>
> For integration with V3 (3.4.5), please refer to the fork https://github.com/ishwar-ikj/webprofile-ref-project
