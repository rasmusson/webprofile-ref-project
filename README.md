The new edition based on OpenSAML V3 is availible here: https://blog.samlsecurity.com/a-guide-to-opensamlv3.html

The sole purpose of the sample project is to illustrate the function of OpenSAML. 
Although, it can be a very good place to start when experimenting with OpenSAML, it should not be used for production purposes.
